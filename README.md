# TwoSum.java

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. O(n)

# PalindromeNumber.java

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.
An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

# PalindromeLinkedList.java

Given the head of a singly linked list, return true if it is a palindrome.


# Powerof2.java

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of two. Otherwise, return false.

An integer n is a power of two, if there exists an integer x such that n == 2x.


# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
